Give you a high five. Why do it yourself if there's a package out there?

## Install
```bash
npm install give-me-five # npm
pnpm add give-me-five # pnpm
bun add give-me-five # bun
yarn add give-me-five # yarn, but why

```

## Examples
```js
import {five} from "give-me-five"

console.log(4 + five) // 9

```

## Contributing

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project is a joke created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.33. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. There is nothing more than the number 5 being provided from this package.
